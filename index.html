            <p>
                I am currently a senior finishing up my Computer Engineering degree at the 
                University of California, San Diego. I've also been interning as a Software Engineer
                at Leidos under their RnD department since June 2022. I mainly work with embedded
                systems in FreeRTOS, but I also do Python scripting and a lot of C/C++. Some of my
                hobbies are gaming, going to the gym, and staying up to the date with the latest movies.

                    Over the last few months at Leidos I have learned to work in the FreeRTOS environment,
                    which is an operating system that allows for multiple processes to run concurrently.
                    This is especially important in embedded systems when there are multiple sensor inputs
                    being received simultaneously. I've worked on implementing RF communication and GPS
                    functionality to multiple microcontrollers. Additionally, I've had to pickup some 
                    understanding of Assembly to help me understand the memory constraints that embedded
                    programs tend to have.
