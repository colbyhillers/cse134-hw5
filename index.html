                <p>
                    I am a senior at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in computer engineering. 
                    Currently, I work as a software engineering intern at Leidos, where I gain valuable experience 
                    in developing embedded systems.
                    <br>
                    In addition to my work experience, I have a strong interest in computer vision, data science, and 
                    web development. I enjoy working with these technologies and constantly look for new and exciting ways 
                    to apply them to solve real-world problems.
                    <br>
                    When I'm not exploring these areas of computer engineering, I love gaming with my friends, with a particular 
                    interest in rocket league, valorant, and valheim. I also enjoy staying fit and active by hitting the gym regularly. 
                    When I'm not studying or working out, I like to explore San Diego and try out new restaurants. I am a big fan of movies 
                    and TV shows and enjoy keeping up to date with the latest releases.
                    <br>
                    With a passion for computer engineering and a love for exploring new hobbies, I am always looking for ways to expand 
                    my horizons and improve my skills. I am excited to see where my career and interests take me in the future.

                    Over the last few months at Leidos I have learned to work in the FreeRTOS environment,
                    which is an operating system that allows for multiple processes to run concurrently.
                    This is especially important in embedded systems when there are multiple sensor inputs
                    being received simultaneously. I've worked on implementing RF communication and GPS
                    functionality to multiple microcontrollers. Additionally, I've had to pickup some 
                    understanding of Assembly to help me understand the memory constraints that embedded
                    programs tend to have.
